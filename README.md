# tmxtract ðŸ—º

My goal with this it is to make easier for people trying to train their own machine translator and hopefully with that help more people to offer their content to a larger audience ðŸ—ºðŸŒŸ

## Purpose ðŸ’¡

This tool is designed to help you to create a basic TMX to bootstrap your translation efforts.
The [tmx files]() can be useful in different situations to train a machine translator.

One of the biggest challenges when training a machine translation model is to get good quality source data. In order to help with that, you can make use of publicly available sources.

## How to use it ðŸ‘Œ

To use it simply download one of the releases to your OS

them to execute you run

```sh
tmxtract -s <source-languge> -d <destiation-language>
```

## Parameters

```apache
Usage: tmxtract [options]

Options:
  -?|-h|--help               Show help information
  --download-folder          Where to download the DGT Files
  -s|--source-language       Language to translate from ex: EN-GB
  -d|--destination-language  Language that you want to translate to ex: ES-ES
  -f|--output-file           Output file
  -n|--max-translations      Number of translations to generate default:100000
  -l|--language-map          Map of languages to be replaced in the resulting doc can be used multiple times Ex: -l ES-ES:es -l EN-UK:en
  -i|--max-doc-id-size       Maximum size for the id of a document
```

## Using it from Source ðŸ’»

### Pre-Requisits

- .net core >= 2.2
- c# >= 7.1 (for the async maind method)

### Downloading and executing ðŸ’¾

On the command line clone the repository and restore and run ðŸ˜Š

It is important to include the basic parameters needed to export

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nepomuceno/tmxtract.git
cd tmxtract/src/tmxtract
dotnet restore
dotnet run -s ES-ES -d EN-GB
```

## Data Source

In this tool I am using [DGT-Translation Memory](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/language-technologies/dgt-translation-memory) from the [European Comission](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en) it is a corpus of professionally translated text in more than 22 languages

![Translation unites](./assets/tu.png)

I download only the files needed until we get to the maximum number of translations required by the parameter `--max-translations`

### Notes on languages

The corpus that we are using have only EU languages so many languages are still needed to be coveres especially to point out Asian languages. if anyone has information of other corpuses of TMX files that could be included I would be happy to add them as sources.

All the language especifications in the corpus are done in capitals and using the full language id. ex: `EN-GB`

Important to remembr since this is a corpus done by the European comission all the languages are with their European variants `PT-PT` `EN-GB` `ES-ES` you can use language maps to map this to your desired outcome. ex: `-l PT-PT:PT-BR` or `-l EN-GB:gb`
