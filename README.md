# tmxtract ðŸ—º

My goal with this it is to make easier for people trying to train their own machine translator and hopefully with that help more people to offer their content to a larger audience ðŸ—ºðŸŒŸ

## Purpose ðŸ’¡

This tool is designed to help you to create a basic TMX to bootstrap your translation efforts.
The [tmx files]() can be useful in different situations to train a machine translator.

One of the biggest challenges when training a machine translation model is to get good quality source data. In order to help with that, you can make use of publicly available sources.

On the command line clone the repository and restore and run ðŸ˜Š

It is important to include the basic parameters needed to export

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nepomuceno/tmxtract.git
cd tmxtract/src/tmxtract
dotnet restore
dotnet run -s ES-ES -d EN-GB
```

## Data Source

In this tool I am using [DGT-Translation Memory](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/language-technologies/dgt-translation-memory) from the [European Comission](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en) it is a corpus of professionally translated text in more than 22 languages
